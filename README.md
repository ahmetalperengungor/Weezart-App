# WEEZART

## Project aim 
Our project aims to create a platform (mobile and web) named Weezart which allows users to store and manage their musical preferences, while presenting recommendations and in-depth analysis of their & their friends' musical tastes. 
#### Login and Registration
Users can log into their account from both web and mobile by creating a free account. After logging in, they will be presented with a neat and clean interface, where users can choose between many options our platform offers.
#### User Input and the Data Format
Users can add songs to their libraries by multiple methods (manual input – json-formatted text file - cloud database), which are added directly from Spotify database in order to maintain integrity (missing information, typos etc.). 
#### Like / Rate Functionalities
When a song is added to the library of the user, they have the option to like the song, as well as give a rating from 1 to 5. Not only songs, but also artists and albums can be liked/ rated by the user.
#### Recommendations and Analysis
Users can get various recommendations based on their musical preferences, which are selected carefully by our recommendation algorithm. In addition, they can see the analysis of their tastes. These analyses include many aspects, ranging from making analysis from the genre of their favorite artists to making analysis from the release date of their highest-rated songs. 
#### Friend Activities
Users can add each other as friends, where they will get special recommendations and musical analysis with their friends. In addition, users have the ability to limit this analysis feature from their friends’ analysis.
#### Data Exporting
Our platform also allows users to export analysis of their libraries and musical analysis - which can be shared across multiple platforms.
